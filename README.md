<h1> Kicks Stock</h1>

<h2>Kicks Stock Overview </h2>

<p>Kicks Stock is an online resell platform/marketplace for limited edition sneakers. Kicks Stock allows users to sell new (deadstock) and lightly worn products that are in a saleable condition. </p>

<p>Sellers can easily register on the platform, list their first item for sale in minutes after creating an account and set pricing at their discretion. Kicks Stock will have recent pricing of previous versions available for sellers and buyers to reference. Buyers can purchase sneakers directly from sellers after creating an account, however, Kicks Stock does not require an account to browse inventory. </p>

<p>The approach used was a combination of Uber, Amazon, and Instagram.  We created a platform like Uber without owning any physical inventory. The simple styling was influenced by Amazon with the approach that the product is the main focus. Instagram influenced mobile UX by a single product view browsing experience. </p>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

<p>The technologies that are:</p> 
<li>7 RESTful routes and full CRUD</li>
<li> Node.js, Mongoose, Express, EJS</li>
<li> MVC file structure: Models, Views, Controllers</li>
<li> Materialize.css</li>

<h2>Next Steps </h2>
 
<p>Next steps for Kick Stock is to build out a shopping cart to execute transactions, bid and trade functionality. The shopping cart history would link to the DB with shopping history so we can collect data on our users for marketing purposes. Bidding will allow users to bid the highest price and trade will allow sellers to trade with other sellers.</p>

<p> Regarding UX, we would build out a user profile to create a community feel and highlight/award badges to top sellers. Social features such as like and favorites will also be added.</p>

<p>Once we have a large member base the goal is to develop an advertising model similar to Amazon. Sellers would receive banner ads promoting their inventory. For example, we could have a brick and mortar retailer buy ads to promote their inventory on the platform. </p>
